La Valle NV Primum Sparkling

Sparkling White Blend (Italy)
$40.0  |  90 points  |  Fruity, Full-Bodied
Aromas of white spring flowers, orchard fruit, citrus and a hint of bread crust lead the nose. The creamy palate offers nectarine zest, ripe yellow apple and toasted walnut accompanied by a firm, refined perlage.

Bellavista 2007 Pas Operé Extra Brut Sparkling

Sparkling White Blend (Italy)
$64.0  |  91 points  |  Fruity, Earthy
Fragrances recall acacia, white spring flowers, honey, bread dough and beeswax. The concentrated palate delivers mature yellow apple, toasted walnut, clove, vanilla and pie crust alongside vivacious, persistent effervescence.

Barone Pizzini 2011 Naturae Sparkling

Sparkling White Blend (Italy)
$45.0  |  92 points  |  Fruity, Savory, Earthy
A blend of 70% Chardonnay and 30% Pinot Nero, this elegant wine opens with an alluring fragrance of white flowers and stone fruit. Made with no dosage, the linear palate offers juicy yellow apple, citrus, toasted almond and a hint of spice. A refined perlage accentuates the mineral finish.

Fratelli Berlucchi 2010 Pas Dosé Vintage Sparkling
--------------------------------------
Sparkling White Blend (Italy)
$45.0  |  91 points  |  Fruity, Earthy, Full-Bodied

The subtle palate delivers citrus, Golden Delicious apple and toasted walnut alongside brisk acidity and a fine mousse.

Ca' del Bosco 2011 Vintage Collection Dosage Zéro Metodo Classico Sparkling
--------------------------------------
Sparkling White Blend (Italy)
$75.0  |  93 points  |  Fruity, Savory, Earthy, Bitter, Full-Bodied
